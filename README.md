## Purpose

The goal for developing this package is to provide functions for exploring, analyzing, and visualizing data about salmon. I am especially interested in the Open Source data that is being organized by the [International Salmon Data Laboratory](https://yearofthesalmon.org/project/international-salmon-data-laboratory/) (ISDL) for the [International Year of the Salmon](https://yearofthesalmon.org/).

## Installation

You can install the latest (development) version of `salmonstats` from [GitHub](https://github.com/jimtyhurst) using the `install_github` command in R:

``` r
remotes::install_github("jimtyhurst/salmonstats")
```

## Vignettes

Several examples of data analysis and visualization are provided in the [vignettes](./vignettes/) directory.

The vignette, [Salmon Data References](./vignettes/salmon-data-references.pdf), provides references to external data sources.
